# clothoid-fitting

This repository encompasses functionalities designed for the fitting of a general path defined by its x and y coordinates through the utilization of clothoid curves. Furthermore, it facilitates the generation of an optimized speed profile predicated upon the clothoid path. The underlying code draws inspiration from the research conducted by Lima et al. as presented in their paper titled "Clothoid-based Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Driving," which was featured in the 2015 European Control Conference (ECC).

Prerequisite libraries for this repository to function properly include gurobi and scipy.
